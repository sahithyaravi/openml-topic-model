principal components obtained with pca  the only features which have not been transformed with pca are  time  and  amount   feature  time  contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset  the feature  amount  is the transaction amount  this feature can be used for example dependant cost senstive learning  feature  class  is the response variable and it

detection contest uses a version of this dataset   lincoln labs set up an environment to acquire nine weeks of raw tcp dump data for a local area network  lan  simulating a typical u s  air force lan  they operated the lan as if it were a true air force environment  but peppered it with multiple attacks   the raw training data was about four gigabytes of compressed binary tcp dump data from seven weeks of network traffic  this was processed into about five million connection records  similarly  the two weeks of test data yielded around two million connection records   a connection is a sequence of tcp packets starting and ending at some well defined times  between which data flows to and from a source ip address to a target ip address under some well defined protocol  each connection is labeled as either normal  or as an attack  with exactly one specific attack type  each connection record consists of about     bytes   attacks fall into four main categories     dos  denial of service  e g  syn flood    r l  unauthorized access from a remote machine  e g  guessing password    u r  unauthorized access to local superuser  root  privileges  e g   various   buffer

examine only the connections in the past two seconds that have the same service as the current connection    same host  and  same service  features are together called time based traffic features of the connection records   some probing attacks scan the hosts  or ports  using a much larger time interval than two seconds  for example once per minute  therefore  connection records were also sorted by destination host  and features were constructed using a window of     connections to the same host instead of a time window  this yields a set of so called host based traffic features   unlike most of the dos and probing attacks  there appear to be no sequential patterns that are frequent in records of r l and u r attacks  this is because the dos and probing attacks involve many connections to some host s  in a very short period of time  but the r l and u r attacks are embedded in the data portions of packets  and normally involve only a single connection   useful algorithms for mining the

paclobutrazol  pp      and flurprimidol  el      on the number and length of internodes in terminal sprouts formed on trimmed silver maple trees    introduction    the trimming of trees under distribution lines on city streets and in rural areas is a major problem and expense for electrical utilities   such operations are routinely performed at intervals of one to eight years depending upon the individual species growth rate and the amount of clearance required   ontario hydro trims about         trees per year at a cost of about     per tree    much effort has been spent in developing chemicals for the horticultural industry to retard the growth of woody and herbaceous plants   recently  a group of new growth regulators was introduced which was shown to be effective in controlling the growth of trees without producing noticeable injury symptoms   in this group are pp       common name paclobutrazol    rs   rs         chlorophenyl          dimethyl              triazol l yl  pentan      ol and el      common name flurprimidol and composition alpha      methylethyl    alpha       trifluromethoxyl  phenyl       pyrimidine   methanol    both el     and pp     have been reported to control excessive sprout growth in a number of species when applied as a foliar spray  as a soil drench  or by trunk injection  sprout length is a function of both the number of internodes and the length of the individual internodes in the sprout   while there have been many reports that both pp     and el     cause a reduction in the length of internodes formed in sprouts on woody plants treated with the growth regulators  there has been but one report that el     application to apple trees resulted in a reduction of the number of internodes formed per sprout    the purpose of the present study was to investigate the length of the terminal sprouts  the length of the individual internodes in those sprouts  and the number of internodes in trimmed silver maple trees following trunk injection with the growth regulators pp     and el        experimental details    multistemmed    year old silver maple trees growing at wesleyville  ontario were trunk injected with methanolic solutions of el     and pp     in may of      using a third generation asplundh tree injector    two different application rates     g l and   g l  were used for each chemical   the volume of solution  and hence the amount of active ingredient  injected into each tree was determined from the diameter of the tree  using the formula  vol ml     dbh   dbh       where dbh is the diameter at breast height   two sets of control trees were included in the experiment   in one set  tree received no injection  control  and in a second set  the trees were injected with methanol  the carrier in the growth regulator solutions   ten trees  chosen at random  were used in each of the control and experimental sets   prior to injection  all the trees were trimmed by a forestry crew  with their heights being reduced by about one third    in january       twenty months after the trees were injected  between six and eight limbs were removed at random from the bottom two thirds of the canopy of each of the ten trees in each experimental and control set   the limbs were returned to the laboratory and the length of all the terminal sprouts  the lengths of the individual internodes  and the number of internodes recorded   between one and    terminal sprouts were found on each limb collected   sprouts which had a length of   cm or less were recorded as being   cm in length  in such spouts  the internode lengths were not measured  but were calculated from the total length of the sprout and the number of internodes counted   internode lengths were then expressed to one decimal place   in two instances  one of the ten trees in a set could not be sampled because limb removal would have jeopardized the health of the tree over the long term    data set    each of the records represents a

1682,534,cps_85_wages, determinants of wages from the      current population survey  summary  the current population survey  cps  is used to supplement census information between census years  these data consist of a random sample of     persons from the cps  with information on wages and other characteristics of the workers  including sex  number of years of education  years of work experience  occupational status  region of residence and union membership  we wish to determine  i  whether wages are related to these characteristics and  ii  whether there is a gender gap in wages  based on residual plots  wages were log transformed to stabilize the variance  age and work experience were almost perfectly correlated  r       multiple regression of log wages against sex  age  years of education  work experience  union membership  southern residence  and occupational status showed that these covariates were related to wages  pooled f test  p           the effect of age was not significant after controlling for experience  standardized residual plots showed no patterns  except for one large outlier with lower wages than expected  this was a male  with    years of experience and    years of education  in a management position  who lived in the north and was not a union member  removing this person from the analysis did not substantially change the results  so that the final model included the entire sample  adjusting for all other variables in the model  females earned                the wages of males  p           wages increased                for every   additional years of education  p           they increased by               for every additional    years of experience  p           union members were paid                more than non union members  p           northerns were paid               more than southerns  p         management and professional positions were paid most  and service and clerical positions were paid least  pooled f test  p           overall variance explained was r         in summary  many factors describe the variations in wages  occupational status  years of experience  years of education  sex  union membership and region of residence  however  despite adjustment for all factors that were available  there still appeared to be a gender gap in wages  there is no readily available explanation for this gender gap

the histopathological features       are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope           in the dataset constructed for this domain  the family history feature       has the value   if any of these diseases has been observed in the       family  and   otherwise  the age feature simply represents the age of       the patient  every other feature  clinical and

1731,1168,electricity_prices_ICON,   icon challenge on forecasting and scheduling     we consider the following problem  you are running a cloud computing service  where customers contract to run computing services  tasks   each task has a duration  an earliest start and latest end  and resource requirements for cpu  memory and i o attributes  the tasks can be scheduled on one of multiple servers  each server has a limited capacity for the cpu  memory and i o attributes  multiple tasks can run concurrently on the same machine if the total resource consumption for all attributes is below the respective capacity  all tasks must be scheduled within their release and due dates  these dates are set so that no task stretches over midnight between two days  tasks can not be interrupted  once started  they must run for their given duration  if a machine is used by a task  it must be running at that time  in addition to the cost of running the allocated tasks  the machine consumes some idle power if it is on  every time a machine is switched on or off  a start up resp  shut down cost must be paid  all machines are off at the beginning of the planning period  all machines must be off at the end of the planning period   the price of electricity for the data centre is a real time price  and varies throughout the day  the actual price is not known in advance  a forecast must be used to generate a schedule  the total cost of the schedule is determined after the fact by applying the actual price of electricity to the energy consumption in each time period  one forecast of the price is given by the organizers  however there may be a large discrepancy between the forecast and actual price  offering the opportunity to generate better forecasts based on historical data for demand and prices  and previous forecast information  note that a forecast with a low error is not automatically guaranteed to lead to a schedule with a low overall cost          in the forecast problem  we have to predict the actual electricity price for one day into the future based on historical and forecasted data  the historical data is available from september

not for males   the flies used were an  outbred stock   sexual activity was manipulated by supplying individual  males with one or eight receptive virgin females per day   the  longevity of these males was compared with that of two control types   the first control consisted of two sets of individual males kept with  one or eight newly inseminated females   newly inseminated females will  not usually remate for at least two days  and thus served as a control  for any effect of competition with the male for food or space   the  second control was a set of individual males kept with no females   there were    males in each of the five groups  which were treated  identically in number of anaesthetizations  using co   and provision of  fresh food medium     source   figure   in the

compliance  of the males in the two experimental groups was documented  as follows   on two days per week throughout the life of each  experimental male  the females that had been supplied as virgins to  that male were kept and examined for fertile eggs   the insemination  rate declined from approximately   females day at age one week to just  under   day at age eight weeks in the males supplied with eight virgin  females per day  and from just under   day at age one week to  approximately     day at age eight weeks in the males supplied with one  virgin female per day   these  compliance  data were not supplied for  individual males  but the authors say that  there were no significant  differences between the individual males within each experimental  group      story behind the data   james hanley found this dataset in  nature  and was attracted by the  way the raw data were presented in classical analysis of covariance  style in figure     he read the data points from the graphs and brought  them to the attention of a colleague with whom he was teaching the  applied statistics course   dr  liddell thought that with only three  explanatory variables  thorax  plus partners and type to describe the  five groups   it would not be challenging enough as a data analysis  project   he suggested adding another variable   james hanley added  sleep  a variable not mentioned in the published article   teachers can  contact us about the construction of this variable    we prefer to  divulge the details at the end of the data analysis project      further discussion of the background and pedagogical use of this  dataset can be found in hanley        and in hanley and shapiro           to obtain the hanley and shapiro article  send the one line  e mail message   send jse v n  datasets hanley  to the address archive jse stat ncsu edu    pedagogical notes   this has been the most successful and the most memorable dataset we  have used in an  applications of statistics  course  which we have  taught for ten years   the most common analysis techniques have been  analysis of variance  classical analysis of covariance  and multiple  regression   because the variable thorax is so strong  it explains  about     of the variance in longevity   it is important to consider it  to increase the precision of between group contrasts   when students  first check and find that the distributions of thorax length  and in  particular  the mean thorax length  are very similar in the different  groups  many of them are willing to say  in epidemiological  terminology  that thorax is not a confounding variable  and that it can  be omitted from the analysis     there is usually lively discussion about the primary contrast   the  five groups and their special structure allow opportunities for  students to understand and verbalize what we mean by the term   statistical interaction      there is also much debate as to whether one should take the sleep  variable into account   some students say that it is an  intermediate   variable   some students formally test the mean level of sleep across  groups  find one pair where there is a statistically significant  difference  and want to treat it as a confounding variable   a few  students muse about how it was measured     there is heteroscedasticity in the longevity variable     one very observant student  now a professor  argued that thorax cannot  be used as a predictor or explanatory variable for the longevity  outcome since fruitflies who die young may not be fully grown  i e   it  is also an intermediate variable   one ph d  student who had studied  entomology assured us that fruitflies do not grow longer after birth   therefore  the thorax length is not time dependent     curiously  the dataset has seldom been analyzed using techniques from  survival analysis   the fact that there are no censored observations is  not really an excuse  and one could easily devise a way to introduce

    ### dataset information    this archive contains       measurements from    chemical sensors utilized in simulations for drift compensation in a discrimination task of   gases at various levels of concentrations     the goal is to achieve good performance  or as low degradation as possible  over time  as reported in the paper mentioned below in section    data collection      the primary purpose of providing this dataset is to make it freely accessible online to the chemo sensor research community and artificial intelligence to develop strategies to cope with sensor concept drift  the dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes  commercial purposes are fully excluded     the dataset was gathered within january      to february          months  in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the chemosignals laboratory in the biocircuits institute  university of california san diego      being completely operated by a fully computerized environment controlled by a labview s national instruments software on a pc fitted with the appropriate serial data acquisition boards  the measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner  minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift     the resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances  namely ammonia  acetaldehyde  acetone  ethylene  ethanol  and toluene  each dosed at a wide variety of concentration values ranging from   to      ppmv  an extension of this dataset with the concentration values is available at  gas sensor array drift dataset at different concentrations data set        ### attribute information    the response of the said sensors is read out in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor  hence each measurement produced a    channel time series  each of which represented by an aggregate of features reflecting all the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated      in particular  two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset     i  the so called steady state feature    r   defined as the difference of the maximal resistance change and the baseline and its normalized version expressed by the ratio of the maximal resistance and the baseline values when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber  and    ii  an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement procedure under controlled conditions  namely the exponential moving average  ema     these aggregate of features is a transform  borrowed from the field of econometrics originally introduced to the chemo sensing community by muezzinoglu et al          that converts the said transient portion into a real scalar  by estimating the maximum value    minimum for the decaying portion of the sensor response    of its exponential moving average  ema     with an initial condition set to zero and a scalar smoothing parameter of the operator      that defines both the quality of the feature and the time of its occurrence along the time series the scalar  set to range between   and    in particular  three different values for    were set to obtain three different feature values from the pre recorded rising portion of the sensor response and three additional features with the same    values but for the decaying portion of the sensor response  covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics      for a more detailed analysis and discussion on these features as well as a graphical illustration of them please refer to section     and figure    respectively of the annotated manuscript     once the abovementioned features are calculated  one is to form a feature vector containing the   features extracted from each particular sensor multiplied by the    sensors considered here  in the end  there is a resulting     dimensional feature vector containing all the features indicated above     there are six possible classes            ethanol      ethylene       ammonia

the following  bilirubin is continuous attribute    the number of it s         values  in the asdohepa dat file is negative       values  are quoted        because when speaking about the continuous

discretized  at the same time  because of the continious        attribute  one can perform some other test since the continuous        information is preserved  i hope that these lines have at least

a nation s hdi is composed of life expectancy  adult literacy and gross national product per capita   by combining these three elements and by pitting each nation s indicators against  the best   we come up with a worldwide hdi   comparing the hdi rating with the traditional gnp per capita rating reveals some poor countries  remarkable progress in human development   these countries got more bang for their development buck by giving their aid to the most needy people   the comparison also shows that some countries  including the u s   did not translate their wealth into social benefits   in the hdi rankings  the arab and moslem countries come out poorly  mainly because of low literacy among women   the formerly communist countries come out rather well because literacy is a priority and their gnp is generally low   latin america comes out with many plusses because their gnps are low while they still enjoy the higher literacy and improved health care investments of earlier years   africa is a mixed lot   some oil exporters  such as angola  gabon  cameroon and the congo  did not translate their wealth into social benefits   others  tanzania  madagascar  zambia  which have poorly managed economies  were still able to improve their people s health and schooling   among the wealthier countries  the physical and educational benefits generally kept pace with improved economies   an exception is the u s   where the economy flourished in the    s but social services stagnated and declined   the chart below lists the world s countries according to their human development index  a measure of quality of life based on life expectancy  adult literacy and gross national product per capita   the nations are ranked from lowest quality of life to highest   the  hdi rank minus gnp rank column measures how well the nations translate the wealth they have into benefits for their citizens   a positive number in this column indicates the country makes good use of its resources to help its people  a negative number indicates it does not                                                                          posted on activist s mailing list  activ l umcvmb  which should

halstead features extractors of source code   these features were defined in the   s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality  the nature of association is under dispute     notes on mccabe and halstead follow       the mccabe and halstead measures are  module  based where a  module  is the smallest unit of functionality  in c or smalltalk   modules  would be called  function  or  method  respectively       defect detectors can be assessed according to the following measures         module actually has defects                                              no            yes                                                   classifier predicts no defects    no        a             b

trigger the detector  the higher the pd  however  effort also gets increases    high pd or low pf comes at the cost of high pf or low pd  respectively   this linkage can be seen in a standard receiver operator curve  roc    suppose  for example  loc  x is used as the detector  i e  we assume large modules have more errors   loc   x represents a family of detectors  at x    every module is predicted to have errors  this detector has a high pd but also a high false alarm rate  at x    no module is predicted to have errors  this detector has a low false alarm rate but won t detect anything at all  at   x pd pf pf    pd    pd   pf  but does not reach it     the line pf pd on the above graph represents the  no information  line  if pf pd then the detector is pretty useless  the better the detector  the more it rises above pf pd towards the  sweet spot      notes on mccabe halstead                            mccabe argued that code with complicated pathways are more error prone   his metrics therefore reflect the pathways within a code module          article mccabe         title     a complexity measure        author     t j  mccabe        pages                     journal

be fault prone  halstead estimates reading complexity by counting the number of concepts in a module  e g  number of unique operators          book halstead         author       m h  halstead        title       elements of software science        publisher    elsevier         year               we study these static code measures since they are useful  easy to use  and widely used       useful  e g  this data set can generate highly accurate predictors for defects    easy to use  static code measures  e g  lines of code  the mccabe halstead measures  can be automatically and cheaply collected     widely used  many researchers use static measures to guide software quality predictions  see the reference list in the above  blind spot  paper  verification and validation  v  v  textbooks advise using static code complexity measures to decide which modules are worthy of manual inspections   further  we know of several large government software contractors that won t review software modules  unless  tools like mccabe predict that they are fault prone   hence  defect detectors have a major economic impact when they may force programmers to rewrite code     nevertheless  the merits of these metrics has been widely criticized   static code measures are hardly a complete characterization of the internals of a function  fenton offers an insightful example where the same functionality is achieved using different programming language constructs resulting in different static measurements for that module  fenton uses this example to argue the uselessness of static code measures

            an alternative interpretation of fenton s example is that static measures can never be a definite and certain indicator of the presence of a fault   rather  defect detectors based on static measures are best viewed as probabilistic statements that the frequency of faults tends to increase in code modules that trigger the detector   by definition  such probabilistic statements will are not categorical claims with some a non zero false alarm rate  the research challenge for data miners is to ensure that these false alarms do not cripple their learned theories     the mccabe

linearly independent paths   a set of paths is said to be linearly independent if no path in the set is a linear combination of any other paths in the set through a program s  flowgraph   a flowgraph is a directed graph where each node corresponds to a program statement  and each arc indicates the flow of control from one statement to another   v g   is calculated by  v g    e   n      where  g  is a program s flowgraph   e  is the number of arcs in the flowgraph  and  n  is the number of nodes in the flowgraph  the standard mccabes rules   v g        are used to identify fault prone module     essential complexity  or  ev g    is the extent to which a flowgraph can be  reduced  by decomposing all the subflowgraphs of  g  that are  d structured primes   such  d structured primes  are also sometimes referred to as  proper one entry one exit subflowgraphs   for a more thorough discussion of d primes  see the fenton text referenced above    ev g   is calculated using  ev g   v g    m  where  m  is the number of subflowgraphs of  g  that are d structured primes     design complexity  or  iv g    is the cyclomatic complexity of a module s reduced flowgraph   the flowgraph   g   of a module is reduced to eliminate any complexity which does not influence the interrelationship between design modules   according to mccabe  this complexity measurement reflects the modules calling

defect prediction using static measures   promise   predictive models in software engineering workshop  icse       may   th       saint louis  missouri  us   we used several machine learning algorithms to predict the defective modules in five nasa products  namely  cm   jm   kc   kc   and pc   a set of static measures were used as predictor variables  while doing so  we observed that a large portion of the modules were small  as measured by lines of code  loc   when we experimented on the data subsets created by partitioning according to module size  we obtained higher prediction performance for the subsets that include larger modules  we also performed defect prediction using class level data for kc  rather than method level data  in this case  the use of class level data resulted in improved prediction performance compared to using method level data  these findings suggest that quality assurance activities can be guided even better if defect predictions are made by using data that belong to larger modules      features   the descriptions of the features are taken from   feature used as the response variable                                         dl  defect level  def if the class is in the top    in defect ranking  nodef otherwise   features at class level originally                                     percent pub data   the percentage of data that is public and protected data in a class  in general  lower values indicate greater encapsulation  it is measure of encapsulation   access to pub data  the amount of times that a class s public and protected data is accessed  in general  lower values indicate greater encapsulation  it is a measure of encapsulation   coupling between objects  the number of distinct non inheritance related classes on which a class depends  if a class that is heavily dependent on many classes outside of its hierarchy is introduced into a library  all the classes upon which it depends need to be introduced as well  this may be acceptable  especially if the classes which it references are already part of a class library and are even more fundamental than the specified class   depth  the level for a class  for instance  if a parent has one child the depth for the child is two  depth indicates at what level a class is located within its class hierarchy  in general  inheritance increases when depth increases   lack of cohesion of methods  for each data field in a class  the percentage of the methods in the class using that data field  the percentages are averaged then subtracted from       the locm metric indicates low or high percentage of cohesion  if the percentage is low  the class is cohesive  if it is high  it may indicate that the class could be split into separate classes that will individually have greater cohesion   num of children  the number of classes derived from a specified class   dep on child  whether a class is dependent on a descendant   fan in  this is a count of calls by higher modules   response for class  a count of methods implemented within a class plus the number of methods accessible to an object class due to inheritance  in general  lower values indicate greater polymorphism   weighted methods per class  a count of methods implemented within a class  rather than all methods accessible within the class hierarchy   in general  lower values indicate greater polymorphism  features transformed to class level  originally at method level                                                                    transformation was achieved by obtaining min  max  sum  and avg values over all the methods in a class  there this data set includes four features for all of the following features that were originally at the method level but transformed to the class level  for example  loc blank has minloc blank  maxloc blank  avgloc blank  and maxloc blank   loc blank  lines with only white space or no text content   branch count  this metric is the number of branches for each module  branches are defined as those edges that exit from a decision node  the greater the number of branches in a program s modules  the more testing resource s required   loc code and comment  lines that contain both code and comment   loc comments   the number of lines in a module  this particular metric includes all blank lines  comment lines  and source lines   cyclomatic complexity  it is a measure of the complexity of a modules decision structure  it is the number of linearly independent paths   design complexity  design complexity is a measure of a module s decision structure as it relates to calls to other modules  this quantifies the testing effort related to integration   essential complexity  essential complexity is a measure of

competition  protecting rivers and streams by monitoring chemical concentrations and algae communities    intelligent techniques for monitoring water quality using chemical indicators and algae population  recent years have been characterised by increasing concern at the impact man is having on the environment  the impact on the environment of toxic waste  from a wide variety of manufacturing processes  is well known  more recently  however  it has become clear that the more subtle effects of nutrient level and chemical balance changes arising from farming land run off and sewage water treatment also have a serious  but indirect  effect on the states of rivers  lakes and even the sea   in temperate climates across the world summers are characterized by numerous reports excessive summer algae growth resulting in poor water clarity  mass deaths of river fish from reduced oxygen levels and the closure of recreational water facilities on account of the toxic effects of this annual algal bloom  reducing the impact of these man made changes in river nutrient levels has stimulated much biological research with the aim of identifying the crucial chemical control variables for the biological processes   the data used in this problem comes from one such study  during the research study water quality samples were taken from sites on different european rivers of a period of approximately one year   these samples were analyzed for various chemical substances including  nitrogen in the form of nitrates  nitrites and ammonia  phosphate  ph  oxygen  chloride  in parallel  algae samples were collected to determine the algae population distributions  it is well known that the dynamics of the algae community is determined by external chemical environment with one or more factors being predominant  while the chemical analysis is cheap and easily automated  the biological part involves microscopic examination  requires trained manpower and is therefore both expensive and slow   diatoms like cymbella are major contributors to primary production throughout the world  the diatom reacts with large sensitivity to even small changes in acidity    over a three and half billion year history algae have evolved and adapted as primary plant colonizers of almost every known habitant in terrestrial and aquatic environments  they respond very rapidly to man made environment changes     the relationship between the chemical and biological features is complex and can be expected to need the application of advanced techniques  typical of such real life problems  the particular data set for the problem contains a mixture of  fuzzy  qualiative variables and numerical measurement values  with much of the data being incomplete   the competition task is the prediction of algal frequency distributions on the basis of  the measured concentrations of the chemical substances and the global information concerning the season when the sample was taken  the river size and its flow velocity  the two last variables are given as linguistic variables       data sets were taken and each contain    values  the first    values of each data set are the season  the river size  the fluid velocity and   chemical concentrations which should be relevant for the algae population distribution  the last   values of each data set are the distribution of different kinds of algae  these   kinds are only a very small part of the whole community  but for the competition we limited the number to    the value     means that the frequency is very low  the data set also contains some empty fields which are labeled with the string xxxxx   each participant in the competition receives     complete data sets  training data  and     data sets  evaluation data  containing only the    values of the river descriptions and the chemical concentrations   this training data is to be used in obtainin a  model  providing a prediction of the algal distributions

population  recent years have been characterised by increasing concern at the impact man is having on the environment  the impact on the environment of toxic waste  from a wide variety of manufacturing processes  is well known  more recently  however  it has become clear that the more subtle effects of nutrient level and chemical balance changes arising from farming land run off and sewage water treatment also have a serious  but indirect  effect on the states of rivers  lakes and even the sea   in temperate climates across the world summers are characterized by numerous reports excessive summer algae growth resulting in poor water clarity  mass deaths of river fish from reduced oxygen levels and the closure of recreational water facilities on account of the toxic effects of this annual algal bloom  reducing the impact of these man made changes in river nutrient levels has stimulated much biological research with the aim of identifying the crucial chemical control variables for the biological processes   the data used in this problem comes from one such study  during the research study water quality samples were taken from sites on different european rivers of

one or more factors being predominant  while the chemical analysis is cheap and easily automated  the biological part involves microscopic examination  requires trained manpower and is therefore both expensive and slow   diatoms like cymbella are major contributors to primary production throughout the world  the diatom reacts with large sensitivity to even small changes in acidity    over a three

environment changes     the relationship between the chemical and biological features is complex and can be expected to need the application of advanced techniques  typical of such real life problems  the particular data set for the problem contains a mixture of  fuzzy  qualiative variables and numerical measurement values  with much of the data being incomplete   the competition task is the

sewage water treatment also have a serious  but indirect  effect on the states of rivers  lakes and even the sea   in temperate climates across the world summers are characterized by numerous reports excessive summer algae growth resulting in poor water clarity  mass deaths of river fish from reduced oxygen levels and the closure of recreational water facilities on account of the toxic effects of this annual algal bloom  reducing the impact of these man made changes in river nutrient levels has stimulated much biological research with the aim of identifying the crucial chemical control

competition  protecting rivers and streams by monitoring chemical concentrations and algae communities    intelligent techniques for monitoring water quality using chemical indicators and algae population  recent years have been characterised by increasing concern at the impact man is having on the environment  the impact on the environment of toxic waste  from a wide variety of manufacturing processes  is well known  more recently  however  it has become clear that the more subtle effects of nutrient level and chemical balance changes arising from farming land run off and sewage water treatment also have a serious  but indirect  effect on the states of rivers  lakes and even the sea   in temperate climates across the world summers are characterized by numerous reports excessive summer algae growth resulting in poor water clarity  mass deaths of river fish from reduced oxygen levels and the closure of recreational water facilities on account of the toxic effects of this annual algal bloom  reducing the impact of these man made changes in river nutrient levels has stimulated much biological research with the aim of identifying the crucial chemical control variables for the biological processes   the data used in this problem comes from one such study  during the research study water quality samples were taken from sites on different european rivers of a period of approximately one year   these samples were analyzed for various chemical substances including  nitrogen in the form of nitrates  nitrites and ammonia  phosphate  ph  oxygen  chloride  in parallel  algae samples were collected to determine the algae population distributions  it is well known that the dynamics of the algae community is determined by external chemical environment with one or more factors being predominant  while the chemical analysis is cheap and easily automated  the biological part involves microscopic examination  requires trained manpower and is therefore both expensive and slow   diatoms like cymbella are major contributors to primary production throughout the world  the diatom reacts with large sensitivity to even small changes in acidity    over a three and half billion year history algae have evolved and adapted as primary plant colonizers of almost every known habitant in terrestrial and aquatic environments  they respond very rapidly to man made environment changes     the relationship between the chemical and biological features is complex and can be expected to need the application of advanced techniques  typical of such real life problems  the particular data set for the problem contains a mixture of  fuzzy  qualiative variables and numerical measurement values  with much of the data being incomplete   the competition task is the prediction of algal frequency distributions on the basis of  the measured concentrations of the chemical substances and the global information concerning the season when the sample was taken  the river size and its flow velocity  the two last variables are given as linguistic variables       data sets were taken and each contain    values  the first    values of each data set are the season  the river size  the fluid velocity and   chemical concentrations which should be relevant for the algae population distribution  the last   values of each data set are the distribution of different kinds of algae  these   kinds are only a very small part of the whole community  but for the competition we limited the number to    the value     means that the frequency is very low  the data set also contains some empty fields which are labeled with the string xxxxx   each participant in the competition receives     complete data sets  training data  and     data sets  evaluation data  containing only the    values of the river descriptions and the chemical concentrations   this training data is to be used in obtainin a  model  providing a prediction of the algal distributions

1921,563,kdd_el_nino-small, el nino data  data type  spatio temporal  abstract  the data set contains oceanographic and surface meteorological readings taken from a series of buoys positioned throughout the equatorial pacific  the data is expected to aid in the understanding and prediction of el nino southern oscillation  enso  cycles   sources  original owner     pacific marine environmental laboratory national oceanic and atmospheric administration us department of commerce  donor     dr di cook department of statistics iowa state university    dicook iastate edu  date donated  june           data characteristics  this data was collected with the tropical atmosphere ocean  tao  array which was developed by the international tropical ocean global atmosphere  toga  program  the tao array consists of nearly    moored buoys spanning the equatorial pacific  measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection  understanding and prediction of seasonal to interannual climate variations originating in the tropics  most notably those related to the el nino southern oscillation  enso  cycles   the moorings were developed by national oceanic and atmospheric administration s  noaa  pacific marine environmental laboratory  pmel   each mooring measures air temperature  relative humidity  surface winds  sea surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of     meters and a few a of the buoys measure currents  rainfall and solar radiation  the data from the array  and current updates  can be viewed on the web at the this address    the data consists of the following variables  date  latitude  longitude  zonal winds  west    east     meridional winds  south    north     relative humidity  air temperature  sea surface temperature and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of     meters  data taken from the buoys from as early as      for some locations  other data that was taken in various locations are rainfall  solar radiation  current levels  and subsurface temperatures   variable characteristics  the latitude and longitude in the data showed that the bouys moved around to different locations  the latitude values stayed within a degree from the approximate location  yet the longitude values were sometimes as far as five degrees off of the approximate location   looking at the wind data  both the zonal and meridional winds fluctuated between     m s and    m s  the plot of the two wind variables showed no linear relationship  also  the plots of each wind variable against the other three meteorolgical data showed no linear relationships   the relative humidity values in the tropical pacific were typically between     and       both the air temperature and the sea surface temperature fluctuated between    and    degrees celcius  the plot of the two temperatures variables shows a positive linear relationship existing  the two temperatures when each plotted against time also have similar plot designs  plots of the other meteorological variables against the temperature variables showed no linear relationship   there are missing values in the data  as mentioned earlier  not all buoys are able to measure currents  rainfall  and solar radiation  so these values are missing dependent on the individual buoy  the amount of data available is also dependent on the buoy  as certain buoys were commissioned earlier than others   all readings were taken at the same time of day   other relevant information  background  the el nino southern oscillation  enso  cycle of            the strongest of the century  created many problems throughout the world  parts of the world such as peru and the unites states experienced destructive flooding from increased rainfalls while the western pacific areas experienced drought and devastating brush fires  the enso cycle was neither predicted nor detected until it was near its peak  this highlighted the need for an ocean observing system  i e  the tao array  to support studies of large scale ocean atmosphere interactions on seasonal to interannual time scales   the tao array provides real time data to climate researchers  weather prediction centers and scientists around the world  forcasts for tropical pacific ocean temperatures for one to two years in advance can be made using the enso cycle data  these forcasts are possible because of the moored buoys  along with drifting buoys  volunteer ship temperature probes  and sea level measurements   research questions  research questions of interest include    how can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world    how do the variables relate to each other    which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations    does the amount of movement of the buoy effect the reliability of the data   when performing an analysis of the data  one should pay attention the possible affect of autocorrelation  using a multiple regression approach to model the data would require a look at autoregression since the weather statistics of the previous days will affect today s weather   data format  the data is

minneapolis  minnesota  us   abstract  quality is becoming increasingly important with the continuous adoption of open source software   previous research has found that there is generally a positive relationship between module size and defect proneness  therefore  in open source software development  it is important to monitor module size and understand its impact on defect proneness  however  traditional approaches to quality modeling  which measure specific system snapshots and obtain future defect counts  are not well suited because open source modules usually evolve and their size changes over time  in this study  we used cox proportional hazards modeling with recurrent events to study the effect of class size on defect proneness in the mozilla product  we found that the effect of size was significant  and we quantified this effect on defect proneness   the full paper can be downloaded from a  gunes koru s website  by following the publications link or from the web site of promise           features   this data set is used to create a conditional cox proportional hazards model  id  a numeric identification assigned to each separate c   class  note that the id s do not increment from the first to the last data row   start  a time infinitesimally greater than the time of the modification that created this observation  practically  modification time   when a class is introduced to a system  a new observation is entered with start    end  either the time of the next modification  or the end of the observation period  or the time of deletion  whichever comes first   event  event is set to   if a defect fix takes place at the time represented by  end   or   otherwise   a class deletion is handled easily by entering a final observation whose event is set to   if the class is deleted for corrective maintenance  or   otherwise   size  it is a time dependent covariate and its column carries the number of source lines of code of the c   classes at time  start

from which this rating is computed are included     the dataset lists statistics for    players  the first    are the top    all time career best rating leaders recognized by the nfl  the   th player  otto graham  has statistics which include his performance in the all america football conference             which is not recognized by the nfl  the statistics given are current through the      regular season  only passers with a minimum of       career passing attempts are included     the nfl describes how to compute its rating in its      document  national football league passer rating system       park avenue  new york  ny                             through the use of tables  no formula is explicitly stated for rating  but  examining the tables in the  national  football league passer rating system  one can infer that nfl passer rating is       completion percentage              touchdown percentage                 interception percentage             yards attempts          where it is understood that the values within each set of square brackets are  truncated to be no smaller than zero and no larger than         this implies a  minimal rating of   and a maximal rating of       or about        if          lt      completion percentage    lt               lt      touchdown percentage     lt                 lt      interception percentage  lt              lt          yards per attempt    lt           which is true of most passers having a reasonable number of passing attempts   then the rating formula simplifies to             completion percentage       touchdown percentage        interception percentage       yards attempt          see johnson               note that the weights on interception percentage and  yards per attempt are greatest in magnitude  closely followed by touchdown  percentage  the weight on completion percentage is a distant fourth in  magnitude       ### classroom use of this data     using the nfl data from meserole         for which the above inequalities  hold  one can uncover  at least approximately  the simplified rating formula  using multiple regression  students can be told that nfl rating is  based on  performance standards established for completion percentage  average gain   touchdown percentage and interception percentage   meserole          but the  actual formula for rating is not widely publicized  once the rating formula is  uncovered  one can see the relative weights that the nfl assigns to these four  performance standards  see barra and neyer        for an alternative   also  by  citing unusual passers who don t satisfy the above inequalities an instructor  can remind students of the dangers of extrapolation when building regression  models  here are a few such unusual passers     name

story behind the data     between january       and may        the mayo clinic conducted a  double blinded randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver   pbc   comparing the drug d penicillamine  dpca  with a placebo  there  were     patients who met the eligibility criteria seen at the clinic while  the trial was open for patient registration  both the treating physician and  the patient agreed to participate in the randomized trial in     of the      cases  the date of randomization and a large number of clinical  biochemical   serologic  and histologic parameters were recorded for each of the      clinical trial patients  the data from the trial were analyzed in      for  presentation in the clinical literature  for that analysis  disease and   survival status as of july        were recorded for as many patients as   possible   by that date      of the     patients had died  with only      not attributable to pbc   eight patients had been lost to follow up  and      had undergone liver transplantation      pbc is a rare but fatal chronic liver disease of unknown cause   with a prevalence of about    cases per million population  the primary  pathologic event appears to be the destruction of interlobular bile ducts   which may be mediated by immunologic mechanisms  the data discussed here are  important in two respects  first  controlled clinical trials are difficult to  complete in rare diseases  and this case series of patients uniformly  diagnosed  treated  and followed is the largest existing for pbc  the  treatment comparison in this trial is more precise than in similar trials  having fewer participants and avoids the bias that may arise in comparing  a case series to historical controls  second  the data present an  opportunity to study the natural history of the disease  we will see that    despite the immunosuppressive properties of dpca  there are no detectable  differences between the distributions of survival times for the dpca and  placebo treatment groups  this suggests that these groups can be combined  in studying the association between survival time from randomization and  clinical and other measurements  in the early to mid     s  the rate of   successful liver transplant increased substantially  and transplant has   become an effective therapy for pbc  the mayo clinic data set is therefore   one of the last allowing a study of the natural history of pbc in patients   who were treated with only supportive care or its equivalent  the pbc data   can be used to  estimate a survival distribution  test for differences   between two groups  and estimate covariate effects via a regression  model  pbc pbc,3,"['pbc', 'case', 'length', 'selection', 'progress_connectionist', 'size', 'trial', 'liver',

2026,516,pbcseq, primary biliary cirrhosis  this data set is a follow up to the original pbc data set  as discussed in appendix d of fleming and harrington  counting processes and survival analysis

year interval  met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug d penicillamine   the first     cases in the data set participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data   the additional     cases did not participate in the clinical trial  but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival   six of those cases were lost to follow up shortly after diagnosis  so the data here are on an additional     cases as well as the     randomized participants  missing data items are denoted by         the f h data set contains only baseline measurements of the laboratory paramters   this data set contains multiple laboratory results  but only on the first     patients   some baseline data values in this file differ from the original pbc file  for instance  the data errors in prothrombin time and age which were discovered after the orignal analysis  during research work on dfbeta residuals    these two data points are discussed in f h  figure          another major difference is that there was significantly more follow up for many of the patients at the time this data set was assembled   one  feature  of the data deserves special comment   the last observation before death or liver transplant often has many more missing covariates than other data rows   the original clinical protocol for these patients specified visits at   months    year  and annually thereafter   at these protocol visits lab values were obtained for a large pre specified battery of tests    extra  visits  often undertaken because of worsening medical condition  did not necessarily have all this lab work   the missing values are thus potentially informative  and violate the usual  missing at random   mcar or mac

2033,32,pendigits,   please cite      uci citation policy        pen based recognition of handwritten digits      we create a digit database by collecting     samples from    writers  the samples written by    writers are used for training  cross validation and writer dependent testing  and the digits written by the other    are used for writer independent testing  this database is also available in the unipen format     we use a wacom pl    v pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated lcd display and a cordless stylus  the input and display areas are located in the same place  attached to the serial port of an intel     based pc  it allows us to collect handwriting samples  the tablet  sends  x  and  y  tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals  sampling rate  of     miliseconds       these writers are asked to write     digits in random order inside boxes of     by     tablet pixel resolution   subject are monitored only during the first entry screens  each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above  subjects are told to write only inside these boxes   if they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing  they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on screen button  the first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices  but subjects are not aware of this       in our study  we use only   x  y   coordinate information  the stylus pressure level values are ignored  first we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions  the raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between   and      tablet input box resolution   the new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between   and      usually  x  stays in this range  since most characters are taller than they are wide       ### attribute information      in order to train and test our classifiers  we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors  a commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the   x t  y t  points  temporal resampling  points regularly spaced in time  or spatial resampling  points regularly spaced in arc length  can be used here  raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable  previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance  because it provides a better alignment between points  our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points  the resampled digits are represented as a sequence of t points   x t  y t    t    t  regularly spaced in arc length  as opposed to the input sequence  which is regularly spaced in time      so  the input vector size is   t  two times the number of points resampled  we considered spatial resampling to t         points in our experiments and found that t   gave the best trade off between accuracy and complexity      the way we used the dataset was to use first half of training for actual training  one fourth for validation and one fourth for writer dependent testing  the test set was used for writer independent testing and is the actual quality measure  pendigits pendigits,9,"['pendigits', 'pen', 'recognition', 'digit', 'writer', 'writer', 'cross', 'validation', 'writer', 'testing', 'digit', 'writer', 'testing', 'wacom', 'pressure', 'tablet', 'display', 'stylus', 'display', 'area', 'place', 'port', 'intel', 'handwriting', 'coordinate', 'level', 'pen', 'interval', 'rate', 'milisecond', 'writer', 'digit', 'order', 'box', 'resolution', 'subject', 'entry', 'screen', 'screen', 'box', 'digit', 'subject', 'box', 'mistake', 'writing', 'content', 'box', 'screen', 'button', 'digit', 'writer', 'device', 'subject', 'stylus', 'pressure', 'level', 'normalization', 'representation', 'translation', 'scale', 'distortion', 'tablet', 'consist', 'resolution', 'coordinate', 'coordinate', 'range', 'range', 'character', 'order', 'classifier', 'digit', 'length', 'vector', 'technique', 'resampling', 'resampling', 'length', 'distance', 'research', 'resampling', 'yield', 'performance', 'alignment', 'algorithm', 'interpolation', 'pair', 'digit', 'sequence', 'length', 'sequence', 'vector', 'size', 'resampling', 'trade', 'accuracy', 'complexity', 'way', 'half', 'validation', 'writer', 'testing', 'writer', 'testing', 'quality', 'measure', 'pendigit']",['pendigits']

for a part of a large clinical trial  carried out by the radiation therapy oncology group in the united states    the full study included patients with squamous carcinoma of    sites in   the mouth and throat  with    participating institutions  though only data   on three sites in the oropharynx reported by the six largest institutions   are considered here  patients entering the study were randomly assigned to   one of two treatment groups  radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy   together with a chemotherapeutic agent   one objective of the study was to   compare the two treatment policies with respect to patient survival         source   the statistical analysis of failure time data  by jd kalbfleisch             rl prentice           published by john wiley   sons

      survival time in days from day of diagnosis               story behind the data     approximately     of the survival times are censored owing primarily to   patients surviving to the time of analysis  some patients were lost  to follow up because the patient moved or transferred to an institution not  participating in the study  though these cases were relatively rare  from   a statistical point of view  an important feature of these data is the   considerable lack of homogeneity between individuals being studied    of course  as part of the study design  certain criteria for patient   eligibility had to be met which eliminated extremes in the extent of disease    but still many factors are not controlled     this study included measurements of many covariates which would be expected   to relate to survival experience  six such variables are given in the data    sex  t staging  n staging  age  general condition  and grade     the site   of the primary tumor and possible differences between participating   institutions require consideration as well          the t n staging classification gives a measure of the extent of the tumor at   the primary site and at regional lymph nodes  t    refers to a small primary   tumor    centimeters or less in largest diameter  whereas t   is a massive   tumor with extension to adjoining tissue  t   and t   refer to intermediate  cases  n   refers to there being no clinical evidence of a lymph node   metastasis and n    n    n   indicate  in increasing magnitude  the extent of   existing lymph node involvement  patients with classifications t   n      t   n     t   n    or t   n    or with distant metastases were excluded   from study     the variable general condition gives a measure of the functional capacity of   the patient at the time of diagnosis    refers to no disability whereas    denotes bed confinement    and   measure intermediate levels   the variable  grade is a measure of the degree of differentiation of the tumor  the degree  to which the tumor cell resembles the host cell  from    well differentiated    to    poorly differentiated     in addition to the primary question whether the combined treatment mode is  preferable to the conventional radiation therapy  it is of considerable   interest to determine the extent to which the several covariates relate to  subsequent survival   it is also imperative in answering the primary question   to adjust the survivals for possible imbalance that may be present in the   study with regard to the other covariates  such problems are similar to those   encountered in the classical theory of linear regression and the analysis of   covariance   again  the need to accommodate censoring is an important   distinguishing point  in many situations it is also important to develop   nonparametric and robust procedures since there is frequently little empirical  or theoretical work to support a particular family of

vowel  they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics ahi  normalised by the total energy ene  integrated on all the frequencies   ahi ene  the phonemes are transcribed as follows  sh as in she  dcl as in dark  iy as the vowel in she  aa as the vowel in dark  and ao as the first vowel in water       ### source    the current dataset was formatted by the keel repository  but originally hosted by the  elena project   the dataset originates from the european esprit      project  roars  the aim of this project was the development and the implementation of a real time analytical system for french and spanish speech recognition       ### relevant information    most of the already existing speech recognition systems are global systems  typically hidden markov models and time delay neural networks  which recognizes signals and do not really use the speech  specificities   on the contrary  analytical systems take into account the articulatory process leading to the different phonemes of a given language  the idea being to deduce the presence of each of the  phonetic features from the acoustic observation     the main difficulty of analytical systems is to obtain acoustical parameters sufficiantly reliable  these acoustical measurements must           contain all the information relative to the concerned phonetic feature        being speaker independent        being context independent        being more or less robust to noise     the primary acoustical observation is always voluminous  spectrum x n different observation moments  and classification cannot been processed directly     in roars  the initial database is provided by cochlear spectra  which may be seen as the output of a filters bank having a constant deltaf f   where the central frequencies are distributed on a  logarithmic scale  mel type  to simulate the frequency answer of the auditory nerves   the filters outputs are taken every   or   msec  integration on   or    msec  depending on the type of phoneme  observed  stationary or transitory        the aim of the present database is to distinguish between nasal and  oral vowels  there are thus two different classes       class     nasals      class     orals            this database contains vowels coming from      isolated syllables  for example  pa  ta  pan       five different attributes were chosen to characterize each vowel  they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics ahi  normalised by the total energy ene  integrated on all the frequencies   ahi ene  each harmonic is signed  positive when it corresponds to a local maximum of the spectrum and negative otherwise     three observation moments have been kept for each vowel to obtain      different instances         the observation corresponding to the maximum total energy ene            the observations taken   msec before and   msec after the observation corresponding to this maximum total energy     from these      initial values     instances for which the amplitude of the   first harmonics was zero were removed  leading to the      instances of the present database  the patterns are presented in a random order     ### past usage      alinat  p

 gmail com  iit delhi     data set information   eeg record contains many regular oscillations  which are believed to reflect synchronized rhythmic activity in a group of neurons  most activity related eeg patterns occur within the following frequency bands  delta            hz    theta          hz   alpha           hz   beta            hz   and gamma            hz   the waves with the frequency of          hz over motor processing areas are called mu rhythm and reflect idling activity in motor areas  it is more pronounced when the subjects are at rest and at least a second before subjects initiate voluntary movement  the mu activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the region moved shows a decrease in amplitude and is called event related desynchronization  erd    for the current study  eeg data was collected for   times on various days from a healthy right handed subject of    years of age  the data was recorded on a medelec profile digital eeg machine  the settings of high frequency filter    hz  low frequency filter     hz  notch filter    hz  sensitivity    micro volts mm  and a sampling rate of     hz were used for the basic signal processing   eight eeg electrodes  c   c   p   p   f   f   t   and t   were placed according to the international standard       system of electrode placement  bipolar and unipolar eeg was recorded from eight ag agci scalp electrodes  which were placed     cm anterior and posterior to the central electrodes c  and c   left and right side of the hemisphere   a  and a  are reference electrodes  the reference electrodes are placed on the left and right ears and the ground electrode on the forehead  eog  electrooculogram  being a noise artifact  was derived from two electrodes  placed on the outer cantus of left and right eye in order to detect eye movement  these eog signals are then used to eliminate eye movement artifacts   the subject was asked to lie down comfortably in a relaxed position with eyes closed and advised to minimize eye movements  the eeg was recorded for the relaxed state for   minutes  following this  an audio beep of    db and      sec  duration was given at the start and end of a   second epoch where the subject was asked to mentally plan lifting of the right hand thumb  this activity is collected as a   second epoch data corresponding to    movement imagery    state  after a gap of   minutes  the same cue is given to repeat the experiment  the whole experiment lasts for approximately    minutes  collecting data for   trials of   second epoch each for normal relaxed state and   trials of   second epoch each for movement imagery  no actual movement is performed during the session  all data sets were visually checked for artifacts before final selection      attribute information   wavelet transform has been applied for feature extraction for eeg classification  however  wavelet transforms pyramidal algorithm work only on approximation coefficients  so it can not identify      hz frequency band  we have extended the methodology by applying wavelet packet analysis  which also decompose detail coefficients  wavelet packet analysis has been used for signal decomposition with equal frequency bandwidth at each level of decomposition  which leads to an equal number of the approximation and detail coefficients  by applying wavelet packet analysis on the

2040,511,plasma_retinol, determinants of plasma retinol and beta carotene levels  summary  observational studies have suggested that low dietary intake or low plasma concentrations of retinol  beta carotene  or other carotenoids might be associated with increased risk of developing certain types of cancer   however  relatively few studies have investigated the determinants of plasma concentrations of these micronutrients  we designed a cross sectional study to investigate the relationship between personal characteristics and dietary factors  and plasma concentrations of retinol  beta carotene and other carotenoids  study subjects  n        were patients who had an elective surgical procedure during a three year period to biopsy or remove a lesion of the lung  colon  breast  skin  ovary or uterus that was found to be non cancerous  we display the data for only two of the analytes  plasma concentrations of the micronutrients varied widely from subject to subject   while plasma retinol levels varied by age and sex  the only dietary predictor was alcohol consumption  r           plasma beta carotene levels were log transformed prior to the analyses due to severe asymmetry of the residuals on the original scale  for log beta carotene  dietary intake  regular use of vitamins  and intake of fiber were associated with higher plasma concentrations  while quetelet index  defined as weight height   in the units kg m    and cholesterol intake were associated with lower plasma levels  adjusting for the other factors  r           there was one extremely high leverage point in alcohol consumption that was deleted prior to the analyses  plasma concentrations of retinol and beta carotene were not correlated  we conclude that there is wide variability in plasma concentrations of these micronutrients in humans  and that much of this variability is associated with dietary habits and personal characteristics   a better understanding of the physiological relationship between some personal characteristics and plasma concentrations of these micronutrients will require further study   authorization  contact authors  reference  these data have not been

database was generated from data purchased from nasa by the australian centre for remote sensing  and used for research at   the centre for remote sensing university of new south wales kensington  po box   nsw      australia   the sample database was generated taking a small section     rows and     columns  from the original data  the binary values were converted to their present ascii form by ashwin srinivasan  the classification for each pixel was performed on the basis of an actual site visit by ms  karen hall  when working for professor john a  richards  at the centre for remote sensing at the university of new south wales  australia  conversion to  x  neighbourhoods and splitting into test and training sets was done by alistair sutherland   data set information  the database consists of the multi spectral values of pixels in  x  neighbourhoods in a satellite image  and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood  the aim is to predict this classification  given the multi spectral values  in the sample database  the class of a pixel is coded as a number  the landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene  the interpretation of a scene by  integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data  maps indicating topography  land use etc  is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing  for example  nasa s earth observing system commencing this decade   existing statistical methods are ill equipped for handling such diverse data types  note that this is not true for landsat mss data considered in isolation  as in this sample database   this data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution  and standard maximum likelihood classification performs very well  consequently  for this data  it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach  one frame of landsat mss imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands  two of these are in the visible region  corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum  and two are in the  near  infra red  each pixel is a   bit binary word  with   corresponding to black and     to white  the spatial resolution of a pixel is about   m x   m  each image contains      x      such pixels  the database is a  tiny  sub area of a scene  consisting of    x     pixels  each line of data corresponds to a  x  square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the   x    sub area  each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands  converted to ascii  of each of the   pixels in the  x  neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel  the number is a code for the following classes   number class   red soil   cotton crop   grey soil   damp grey soil   soil with vegetation stubble   mixture class  all types present    very damp grey soil nb  there are no examples with class   in this dataset    the data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset  in each line of data the four spectral values for the top left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top middle pixel and then those for the top right pixel  and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left to right and top to bottom  thus  the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes          and     if you like you can use only these four attributes  while ignoring the others  this avoids the problem which arises when a  x  neighbourhood straddles a boundary   attribute information  the attributes are numerical  in the range   to       uci   satellite image satellite_image,15,"['satellite_image',

2147,40,sonar, name  sonar  mines vs  rocks    summary  this is the data set used by gorman and sejnowski in their study  of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network       the  task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced  off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock     source  the data set was contributed to the benchmark collection by terry  sejnowski  now at the salk institute and the university of california at  san deigo   the data set was developed in collaboration with r  paul  gorman of allied signal aerospace technology center     maintainer  scott e  fahlman    problem description     the file  sonar mines  contains     patterns obtained by bouncing sonar  signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various  conditions   the file  sonar rocks  contains    patterns obtained from  rocks under similar conditions   the transmitted sonar signal is a  frequency modulated chirp  rising in frequency   the data set contains  signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles  spanning     degrees for the cylinder and     degrees for the rock     each pattern is a set of    numbers in the range     to       each number  represents the energy within a particular frequency band  integrated over  a certain period of time   the integration aperture for higher frequencies  occur later in time  since these frequencies are transmitted later during  the chirp     the label associated with each record contains the letter  r  if the object  is a rock and  m  if it is a mine  metal cylinder    the numbers in the  labels are in increasing order of aspect angle  but they do not encode the  angle directly     methodology      this data set can be used in a number of different ways to test learning  speed  quality of ultimate learning  ability to generalize  or combinations  of these factors     in      gorman and sejnowski report two series of experiments  an   aspect angle independent  series  in which the whole data set is used  without controlling for aspect angle  and an  aspect angle dependent   series in which the training and testing sets were carefully controlled to  ensure that each set contained cases from each aspect angle in  appropriate proportions     for the aspect angle independent experiments the combined set of     cases  is divided randomly into    disjoint sets with    cases in each   for each  experiment     of these sets are used as training data  while the   th is  reserved for testing   the experiment is repeated    times so that every  case appears once as part of a test set   the reported performance is an  average over the entire set of    different test sets  each run    times     it was observed that this random division of the sample set led to rather  uneven performance   a few of the splits gave poor results  presumably  because the test set contains some samples from aspect angles that are  under represented in the corresponding training set   this motivated gorman  and sejnowski to devise a different set of experiments in which an attempt  was made to balance the training and test sets so that each would have a  representative number of samples from all aspect angles   since detailed  aspect angle information was not present in the data base of samples  the      samples were first divided into clusters  using a    dimensional  euclidian metric  each of these clusters was then divided between the      member training set and the     member test set       the actual training and testing samples used for the  aspect angle  dependent  experiments are marked in the data files   the reported  performance is an average over    runs with this single division of the  data set     a standard back propagation network was used for all experiments   the  network had    inputs and   output units  one indicating a cylinder and the  other a rock   experiments were run with no hidden units  direct  connections from each input to each output  and with a single hidden layer  with              or    units   each network was trained by     epochs over  the entire training set     the weight update formulas used in this study were slightly different from  the standard form   a learning rate of     and momentum of     was used   errors less than     were treated as zero   initial weights were uniform  random values in the range      to          results      for the angle independent experiments  gorman and sejnowski report the  following results for networks with different numbers of hidden units     hidden   right on std    right on std   units training set dev  test set dev

std    right on std   units training set dev  test set dev                                                                                                                                                                                                not surprisingly  the network s performance on the test set was somewhat  better when the aspect angles in the training and test sets were balanced     gorman and sejnowski further report that a nearest neighbor classifier on  the same data gave an       probability of correct classification     three trained human subjects were each tested on     signals  chosen at  random from the set of     returns used to create this data set   their  responses ranged between     and     correct   however  they may have been  using information from the raw

2176,505,tecator, this is the tecator data set  the task is to predict the fat content of a meat sample on the basis of its near infrared absorbance spectrum     statement of permission from tecator  the original data source   these data are recorded on a tecator infratec food and feed analyzer working in the wavelength range            nm by the near infrared transmission  nit  principle  each sample contains finely chopped pure meat with different moisture  fat and protein contents   if results from these data are used in a publication we want you to mention the instrument and company name  tecator  in the publication  in addition  please send a preprint of your article to  karin thente  tecator ab  box     s        hoganas  sweden  the data are available in the public domain with no responsability from the original data source  the data can be redistributed as long as this permission note is attached  for more information about the instrument   call perstorp analytical s representative in your area       description of the data file  for each meat sample the data consists of a     channel spectrum of absorbances and the contents of moisture  water   fat and protein  the absorbance is  log   of the transmittance measured by the spectrometer  the three contents  measured in percent  are determined by analytic chemistry   there are     samples which are divided into   data sets for the purpose of model validation and extrapolation studies  the data sets  further described in reference    are   data set  use               samples c         traning

file      lines per sample  the data sets appear in the order of the table above  the spectra are preprocessed using a principal component analysis on the data set c  and the first    principal components  scaled to unit variance  are included for each sample  thus if you want to use the data for a standard  interpolation  test of your algorithm  use sample       for training and sample         for testing  and ignore the last    samples   and use the first    or so principal components to predict the fat content   each line contains the     absorbances followed by the    principal components and finally the contents of moisture  fat and protein   preceeding the data lines  the following lines appear   real in     real out   training examples     test examples    extrapolation examples         more details on how to use the data  the data are made available as a benchmark for regression models  in order to compare models  it is practical to use the data set as follows   c and m combined are used to tune  estimate  train  the model   some approaches set aside some training data to control overfitting  these data should be a subset of c m  in     the subset m was used for this purpose    t is used to test the model once it has been tuned  if each model has an element of randomness  as is the case for neural networks  the most reliable measure of performance of a single model is obtained by selecting a handful of models on the basis of c m and quoting the average of the performances on t  in the presence of randomness it is bad practice to train a lot of models on c m and then select the best of these on the basis of t   c  m and t are drawn from the same pool of data  so t is used to test the ability of the models to interpolate  the data sets e  and e  contain more fat and protein respectively and are intended to be used to test the ability of the models to extrapolate       performance of neural network models  the performance is measured as standard error of prediction  sep  which is the root mean square of the difference between the true and the predicted content   for the prediction of fat on the data set t the following results were

principal components analysis is a very classical method in pattern recognition  duda     pca reduces the sample dimension in a linear way for the best representation in lower dimensions keeping the maximum of inertia  the best axe for the representation is however not necessary the best axe for the discrimination  after pca  features are selected according to the percentage of initial inertia which is covered by the different axes and the number of features is determined according to the percentage of initial inertia to keep for the classification process     this selection method has been applied on the texture cr database  when quasi linear correlations exists between some initial features  these redundant dimensions are removed by pca and this preprocessing is then recommended  in this case  before a pca  the determinant of the data covariance matrix is near zero  this database is thus badly conditioned for all process which use this information  the quadratic classifier for example      the following file is available for the texture database    texture pca dat z    it is the projection of the   texture cr   database on its principal components  sorted in a decreasing order of the related inertia percentage  so  if you desire to work on the database projected on its x first principal components you only have to keep the x first attributes of the texture pca dat database and the class labels  last attribute       table here below provides the inertia percentages associated to the eigenvalues corresponding to the principal component axis sorted in the decreasing order of the associated inertia percentage        percent of the total database inertia will remain if the    first principal components are kept                 eigen value   inertia

each learning sample belongs to a particular class  duda     the number of discriminant features selected by dfa is fixed in function of the number of classes  c  and of the number of input dimensions  d   this number is equal to the minimum between d and c    in the usual case where d is greater than c  the output dimension is fixed equal to the number of classes minus one and the discriminant axes are selected in order to maximize the between variance and to minimize the within variance of the classes     the discrimination power  ratio of the projected between variance over the projected within variance  is not the same for each discriminant axis  this ratio decreases for each axis  so for a problem with many classes  this preprocessing will not be always efficient as the last output features will not be so discriminant  this analysis uses the information of the inverse of the global covariance matrix  so the covariance matrix must be well conditioned  for example  a preliminary pca must be applied to remove the linearly correlated dimensions      the discriminant factorial analysis  dfa  has been applied on the    first principal components of the texture pca database  thus by keeping only the    first attributes of these databases before to apply the dfa preprocessing  in order to build the texture dfa dat z database file  having    dimensions  the texture database having    classes   in the case of the texture database  experiments shown that a dfa preprocessing is very useful and most of the time improved the classifiers performances      duda    duda  r o

quit  in this paper we present various approaches for automatic topology optimization of backpropagation networks  first of all  we review the basics of genetic algorithms which are our essential tool for a topology search  then we give a survey of backprop and the topological properties of feedforward networks  we report on pioneer work in the filed of topology  optimization  our first approach was based on evolutions strategies which used only mutation to change the parent s topologies  now  we found a way to extend this approach by an crossover operator which is essential to all genetic search methods  in contrast to competing approaches it allows that two parent networks with different number of units can mate and produce a  valid  child network  which inherits genes from both of the parents  we applied our genetic algorithm to a medical classification problem which is extremly difficult to solve  the performance with respect to the training set and a test set of pattern samples was compared to fixed network topologies  our results confirm that the topology optimization makes sense  because the generated networks outperform the fixed topologies and reach classification performances near optimum                                                                                    randolf werner  evol infko uni koblenz de  thyroid ann

    history           this data was originally gathered at the ti in         by           jp siebert  it was partially financed by barr and stroud ltd            the original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing            d objects within a  d image by application of an ensemble of           shape feature extractors to the  d silhouettes of the objects            measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes           of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a class            ification rule tree by means of computer induction             this object recognition strategy was successfully used to            discriminate between silhouettes of model cars  vans and buses           viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation             the rule tree classification performance compared favourably           to mdc  minimum distance classifier  and k nn  k nearest neigh            bour  statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and           computational efficiency  an investigation of these rule trees           generated by example indicated that the tree structure was            heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects  and grouped           similar object views into single decisions       description            the features were extracted from the silhouettes by the hips            hierarchical image processing system  extension binatts  which            extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising           both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance            skewness and kurtosis about the major minor axes and heuristic           measures such as hollows  circularity  rectangularity and           compactness             four  corgie  model vehicles were used for the experiment            a double decker bus  cheverolet van  saab      and an opel manta                this particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the            expectation that the bus  van and either one of the cars would           be readily distinguishable  but it would be more difficult to           distinguish between the cars             the images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the           model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation       degrees           to the horizontal   the vehicles were placed on a diffuse           backlit surface  lightbox   the vehicles were painted matte black           to minimise highlights  the images were captured using a crs               framestore connected to a vax      all images were captured with           a spatial resolution of    x    pixels quantised to    greylevels            these images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes            negated  to comply with the processing requirements of binatts  and           thereafter subjected to shrink expand expand shrink hips modules to           remove  salt and pepper  image noise             the vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured           using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle    and     degrees           corresponded to  head on  and  rear  views respectively while    and               corresponded to profiles in opposite directions  two sets of              images  each set covering a full     degree rotation  were captured           for each vehicle  the vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between            images  these datasets are known as e  and e  respectively             a further two sets of images  e  and e   were captured with the camera

siebert  it was partially financed by barr and stroud ltd            the original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing            d objects within a  d image by application of an ensemble of           shape feature extractors to the  d silhouettes of the objects            measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes           of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a class            ification rule tree by means of computer induction             this object recognition strategy was successfully used to            discriminate between silhouettes of model cars  vans and buses           viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation             the rule tree classification performance compared favourably           to mdc  minimum distance classifier  and k nn  k nearest neigh            bour  statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and           computational efficiency  an investigation of these rule trees           generated by example indicated that the tree structure was            heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects  and grouped           similar object views into single decisions       description            the features were extracted from the silhouettes by the hips            hierarchical image processing system  extension binatts  which            extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising           both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance            skewness and kurtosis about the major minor axes and heuristic           measures such as hollows  circularity  rectangularity and           compactness             four  corgie  model vehicles were used for the experiment            a double decker bus  cheverolet van  saab      and an opel manta                this particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the            expectation that the bus  van and either one of the cars would           be readily distinguishable  but it would be more difficult to           distinguish between the cars             the images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the           model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation       degrees           to the horizontal   the vehicles were placed on a diffuse           backlit surface  lightbox   the vehicles were painted matte black           to minimise highlights  the images were captured using a crs               framestore connected to a vax      all images were captured with           a spatial resolution of    x    pixels quantised to    greylevels            these images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes            negated  to comply with the processing requirements of binatts  and           thereafter subjected to shrink expand expand shrink hips modules to           remove  salt and pepper  image noise             the vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured           using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle    and     degrees           corresponded to  head on  and  rear  views respectively while    and               corresponded to profiles in opposite directions  two sets of              images  each set covering a full     degree rotation  were captured           for each vehicle  the vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between            images  these datasets are known as e  and e  respectively             a further two sets of images  e  and e   were captured with the camera            at elevations of      degs and      degs respectively  these sets           also contain    images per vehicle apart from e  van which contains           only    owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image           at some orientations       attributes
